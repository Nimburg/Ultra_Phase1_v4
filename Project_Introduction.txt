Project Introduction. 

Project Ultra has its namesake from the WW II designation by the British military intelligence for its secret signals intelligence 
operations. As such, this project is intended to create an "Active prediction model", through analyzing the duel networks of user behavior
and information correlation, with Twitter API as the current data source.

Project Ultra is intended to have at least three phases. Phase 1 would be data collection, data cleaning, data filtering and data storage.
Phase 2 would be some preliminary analysis, classification of information and users, and potentially sentimental analysis. Phase 3 would 
build on top of Phase 2, with additional insights borrowed from "relevant" mathematical disciplines, to create a prediction model, which
would not only make predictions with past observations, but also make predictions about inputs that one should "insert" into the system, 
should one is expecting some desired results from the system itself.

This upload is Phase 1 of Project Ultra. This is the 4th rewrite, as well as the 1st version which could analyze data in a speed that is 
at least 10 times faster that real world time speed.
