Project Introduction. 

Project Ultra has its namesake from the WW II designation by the British military intelligence for 
its secret signals intelligence operations. As such, this project is intended to create an "Active 
prediction model", through analyzing the duel networks of user behavior and information correlation, 
with Twitter API as current data source.

Project Ultra is intended to have at least three phases. Phase 1 would be data collection, data cleaning, 
data filtering and data storage.

Phase 2 would be some preliminary analysis, classification of information and users, and potentially 
sentimental analysis. 

Phase 3 would build on top of Phase 2, with additional insights borrowed from "relevant" mathematical 
disciplines, to create a prediction model, which would not only make predictions with past observations, 
but also make predictions about inputs that one should "insert" into the system, should one is expecting 
some desired results from the system itself.

This upload is Phase 1 of Project Ultra. This is the 4th rewrite, as well as the 1st version which could 
analyze data at a speed that is at least 10 times faster that real world time speed.
